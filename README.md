The 3 files we have included aim to demonstrate the functionality of Solidity contracts.
A Solidity contract is comprised of functions and data (state) and lives at a specific address on the Ethereum blockchain. The most basic contract (BasicContract.sol) contains 3 main elements - a state variable called storedData and 2 functions, set() and get(). The functions preform only the most basic functionalities: get() returns storedData, and set() sets/changes the value of storedData. Technically, one can simply use set() to assign whatever value they wish to storedData. However, since all transactions/previous values are stored in the Ethereum blockchain, major discrepancies such as this are easy to locate.

Ballot.sol is a solidity contract made for voting. This contract helps the main problems of electronic voting which is how to assign voting rights to the correct persons and how to prevent manipulation. The startegy is to create one contract per ballot, providing a short name for each option. Then the creator of the contract who serves as chairperson will give the right to vote to each address individually. The persons behind the addresses can then choose to either vote themselves or to delegate their vote to a person they trust.
